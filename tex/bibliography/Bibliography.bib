    abstract  = {Power systems are experiencing a large amount of renewable generation with highly stochastic and partly unpredictable characteristics. This change in energy production implies significant consequences related to the provision of ancillary services (AS). Current markets dedicated to the provision of AS are not able to benefit from the flexible energy resources. They also cannot cope with the new level of stochasticity, non-linearity, and dynamics of generation and flexibility. To overcome such issues and exploit the potential of flexibility resources, a new strategy is required. In this paper, by capitalizing on flexibility resources' potential, AS 4.0 approach is proposed, which offers a comprehensive solution for the AS provision in the smart grid era.},

    abstract  = {Power networks are undergoing a fundamental transition, with traditionally passive consumers becoming 'prosumers' - proactive consumers with distributed energy resources, actively managing their consumption, production and storage of energy. A key question that remains unresolved is: how can we incentivize coordination between vast numbers of distributed energy resources, each with different owners and characteristics? Virtual power plants and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offer different sources of value to prosumers and the power network, and have been proposed as different potential structures for future prosumer electricity markets. In this Perspective, we argue they can be combined to capture the benefits of both. We thus propose the concept of the federated power plant, a virtual power plant formed through P2P transactions between self-organizing prosumers. This addresses social, institutional and economic issues faced by top-down strategies for coordinating virtual power plants, while unlocking additional value for P2P energy trading.},

The term and its association with price signals has, however caused some confusion as to its correct definition, either as a control or a market concept. This paper aims to provide a conceptual introduction to 'indirect control' for management of small and distributed demand side resources. A review of control concepts and an analysis of 'indirectness' features are provided to create a framework for systematic classification of indirect control strategies. The concepts developed then enable a discussion of control performance and valuation of direct- and indirect control strategies. © 2012 IEEE.},
